# HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION MODEL
## **PROJECT SYNOPSIS**
> In this project, I play the role of a Data Analyst for a Real Estate Investment Trust. The Trust would like to start investing in residential real estate. The task at hand is to determine the market price of a house given a set of features. The project predicts housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on. A Jupyter notebook has been provided in this repository.
___
## **TOOLS USED**
This project uses Python for both the analysis and the visualization. An eclectic range of Python libraries have, however, been used:
- Python 3.8 (visualization + analysis)
- Jupypter Notebook (IDE)
___

## **DATASET DESCRIPTION**
This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes houses sold between May 2014 and May 2015. It was taken from a Kaggle upload (https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction).

Here is the description of the data:
- id:	A notation for a house
- date:	Date house was sold
- price:	Price is prediction target
- bedrooms:	Number of bedrooms
- bathrooms:	Number of bathrooms
- sqft_living:	Square footage of the home
- sqft_lot:	Square footage of the lot
- floors:	Total floors (levels) in house
- waterfront:	House which has a view to a waterfront
- view:	Has been viewed
- condition:	How good the condition is overall
- grade:	overall grade given to the housing unit, based on King County grading system
- sqft_above:	Square footage of house apart from basement
- sqft_basement:	Square footage of the basement
- yr_built:	Built Year
- yr_renovated:	Year when house was renovated
- zipcode:	Zip code
- lat:	Latitude coordinate
- long:	Longitude coordinate
- sqft_living15:	Living room area in 2015 (implie some renovations) | This might or might not have affected the lotsize area
- sqft_lot15:	LotSize area in 2015 (implies some renovations)
